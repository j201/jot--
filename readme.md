#Jot--

### The single character programming language!

Jot-- is an extension to the [Jot](http://semarch.linguistics.fas.nyu.edu/barker/Iota/#Goedel) programming language that makes coding as simple as holding down a key. The length of your code is converted to a binary number, which is then run as a Jot program. So, not only is Jot-- Turing-complete, but it can be coded using any characters you want!

####Example

```
var jot__ = require('jot--');

jot__('aaaaaaaaaa'); // The I combinator!
jot__('DESUDESUDESUDESUDESUDESUDESU'); // The K combinator!
jot__("And again, the Internet is not something that you just dump something on. It's not a big truck. It's a series of tubes. And if you don't understand, those tubes can be filled and if they are filled, when you put your message in, it gets in line and"); // The S combinator!
```

####Installation

`npm install jot--`
